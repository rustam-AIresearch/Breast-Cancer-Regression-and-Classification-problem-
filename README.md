This study explores a range of machine learning
techniques, including both regression and classification models,
to predict these outcomes based on patient data. Classification
models like Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression and Decision tree were employed to classify
patients into predefined categories, such as responder or nonresponder to treatment. Additionally, regression models were
utilized to predict continuous outcomes, offering insights into
the exact degree of response or survival time. These models
were chosen for their robustness, interpretability, and ability
to capture complex, non-linear relationships within the dataset.
The methodologies involve mathematical formulations such as
optimization of decision boundaries in SVM, loss function minimization in XGBoost, and error reduction in regression tasks.
By integrating both regression and classification approaches, this
study provides a comprehensive framework for predicting breast
cancer outcomes, aiding clinicians in making informed, datadriven decisions.
